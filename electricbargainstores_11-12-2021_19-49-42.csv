Kidde P4010ACS-W (21027320) AC/DC Hardwired Intelligent Wire-Free Interconnect Smoke Alarm with 10-Year Sealed Battery Backup,KIDDE-P4010ACS-W,$42.98,"Technical Spec The P4010ACS-W is an AC/DC powered smoke alarm with 10 year battery backup that features supervised wire-free interconnect capability and provides enhanced intelligibility for users. The voice warning feature accompanies the 85dB tone during an alarm event, and helps reduce confusion with verbal announcements such as “Replace alarm” at end of alarm life, and “Hush mode activated” when a nuisance alarm is silenced. The three color LED ring helps users quickly determine standby, alarm, or error mode of the alarm. Kidde P4010 Series Alarms contain 10-year tamper proof batteries that eliminate the need for battery replacement, and ends worry over unauthorized removal. Users are further shielded from late night battery chirps by the unit’s Ambient Light Sensing feature, which establishes a day/night cycle and prevents alarm chirping in dark conditions. Wire-Free or hardwire interconnect triggers each connected alarm in the home to sound once smoke is detected. This can provide more time to react. The National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code (NFPA 72) has required smoke alarms in new homes to be interconnected since 1989, which traditionally involves running wiring to each alarm. Older and remodeled homes can now be updated to current standards without having to run new interconnect wiring to each alarm (AC power wiring still required). Existing networks of interconnected alarms can be expanded with use of a single P4010ACS-W and additional Kidde Wire-Free alarms. Additional benefits and features are available when used in conjunction with the Kidde RemoteLync Bridge, which connects P4010 Wire-Free alarms via your home’s Wi-Fi to your smart device. Additional information such as battery life and sensor health status are available from each assigned room location. Weather alerts, and intruder alerts (when used with the Kidde RemoteLync camera), can be sent to each connected alarm, creating an easy to install fire – security – weather – warning system from one network of devices Features & Benefits 10-Year Sealed Lithium Battery: eliminates late night battery chirp Voice Notifications Bug Screen: Protects alarm from insect ingression Flashing LED Status Ring: allows easy identification of current state of alarm Supervised Wire-Free Interconnect: Proprietary radio signal joins multiple alarms together, so when one alarm sounds they all sound. User is alerted if an alarm loses connection to the network. Sealed-in Lithium Battery Backup: No battery replacement required over the 10 year life of the alarm. 10-Year Limited Warranty Compatible with RemoteLync Bridge: Connect to the Kidde app for additional features and benefits. End of Unit Life Warning: Alerts user the alarm is in need of replacement. Test / Hush Button: Tests alarm circuitry and activates Hush® feature to temporarily silence nuisance alarms for up to 10 minutes. End of Unit Life and Network Error chirps can also be silenced. Alarm Locate Feature: Quickly find initiating alarm by silencing other alarms in the network. Ambient Light Sensing: Establishes Day/Night cycle and prevents chirping during the night until the next Day cycle begins. Photoelectric Sensor: Smoke alarm contains advanced photoelectric sensor that may detect visible particles (associated with smoldering fires) sooner than ionization alarms. Easy to Install: Simply turn the switch on the back of unit or mount to bracket to activate the alarm. Multiple units can be interconnected with push of one button. Voice Notifications: Unit verbally announces “Fire!” and other alerts such as “Replace Alarm,” which helps the user better understand current status of the unit.

Kidde 2070-VASR (21028502) TruSense AC Hardwired Smoke Alarm,KIDDE-2070-VASR,$41.88,"Technical Spec  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION The 2070-VASR is an AC/DC powered smoke alarm that features the new Kidde TruSense multi-criteria optical smoke sensor, voice notifications, and easy to use front load battery door. Why TruSense? As home furnishings and construction materials have transitioned to the use of synthetic materials, which may react differently in a home fire, the industry standards for smoke alarms have changed. Smoke alarms will be required to pass both flaming and smoldering polyurethane tests, as well as a nuisance test whereby devices must not alarm when subjected to certain types of cooking. Kidde's TruSense Technology meets the latest industry standards to respond to these types of fires, and helps reduce cooking nuisance alarms. Users will be alerted to actual fire emergencies and won't be as tempted to disable an alarm to avoid nuisance alarms. PRODUCT FEATURES Multi Criteria Optical Sensor: Detects more types of fires and reduces cooking nuisance alarms. Voice Notifications: Unit verbally announces alerts such as ""Fire!"" and ""Low Battery,"" which helps the user better understand current status of the unit. Front Loading Battery Door: Quickly change the backup battery without removing the alarm from the mounting bracket. Three Color LEDs: Receive visual notifications of alarm status: Green: Alarm is operational Amber: Low battery / unit error Red: Smoke detected Test / Hush Button: Tests alarm circuitry and activates Hush feature to temporarily silence nuisance alarms for up to 10 minutes.

Kidde  i1040 Micro 10-Year Sealed Battery Smoke Alarm,KIDDE-I1040,$14.88,"Technical Spec  The Kidde i1040 is a 10-year, sealed battery, ionization, smoke alarm with Alarm Memory and Hush® feature. The i1040 alarm will automatically activate when it is attached to the mounting bracket; there are no pull-tabs, no switches, everything is automatic. When the unit reaches low battery condition (approx 10 years after power up), it will chirp, indicating the alarm is in need of replacement. The customer can use a simple tool such as a screwdriver to deactivate the unit, stopping the low battery chirp and making it safe for disposal. The sealed-in board-mounted battery will power the i1040 unit for its complete 10-year life. No replacement battery will ever be needed. This alarm uses ionization sensing technology. Ionization sensing alarms may detect invisible fire particles (associated with flaming fires) sooner than photoelectric alarms. Photoelectric sensing alarms may detect visible particles (associated with smoldering fires) sooner than ionization alarms. Leading authorities recommend that both ionization and photoelectric smoke alarms be installed to help ensure maximum detection of the various types of fire that can occur within the home. The Kidde i1040 sealed battery operated smoke alarm features a self-activation mechanism making installation simple and easy. It also has a Hush® feature allowing consumers to temporarily silence nuisance alarms and a low battery alert indicating it is time to replace the alarm. At the end of the alarm’s 10-year life, deactivation of the alarm is just as easy. Using a tool such as a small screwdriver, a deactivation switch removes power from the alarm and renders the battery safe for disposal. The alarm lockout feature mechanically prevents a deactivated unit from being mounted back on the mounting bracket. Features & Benefits Sealed-In Lithium Battery – Sealed-in lithium power supply; no battery replacement required over the 10 year life of the alarm. Eliminates worry about battery removal or unauthorized deactivation of alarm. Self Activation – Alarm automatically activates when attached to the mounting bracket. Alarm Memory – Rapidly flashing LED alerts user if the alarm has sounded since the last time the test/reset button was used. Will temporarily silence nuisance alarms and will not allow Hush® mode to be activated unless the unit is in alarm mode. Test/Hush® Button – Tests unit’s circuit operation and resets memory after an alarm condition occurs. LED – A flashing red indicator light with four modes of operation: standby, alarm mode, Hush® mode, and memory set.

Utilizing the latest LED technology, the Prevail luminaire delivers unparalleled uniformity resulting in greater pole spacing. A versatile mount standard arm facilitates ease of installation for both retrofit and new installations. With energy savings greater than 62%, the Prevail fixture replaces 150-450W metal halide fixtures in general area lighting applications such as parking lots, walkways, roadways and building areas. PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS Construction Construction is comprised of a heavy-duty, single-piece die-cast aluminum housing. The LED drivers are mounted in direct contact with the casting to promote low operating temperature and long life. The die-cast aluminum door is tethered to provide easy access to the driver if replacement is required. A one-piece silicone gasket seals the door to the fixture housing. The optics is mounted on a versatile, aluminum plate that dissipates heat from the LEDs resulting in longer life of the fixture. The fixture is IP66 and 3G vibration rated (ANSI C136.31) to insure strength of construction and longevity in the selected application. Optics Precision molded, high efficiency optics are precisely designed to shape the distribution, maximizing efficiency and application spacing. Available in Type II, III, IV and V distributions with lumen packages ranging from 6,100 to 18,900 nominal lumens. Light engine configurations consist of 1 or 2 high-efficacy LEDs mounted to metal-core circuit boards to maximize heat dissipation and promote long life (up to L92/60,000 hours at 25 degree C) per IESNA TM-21. For the ultimate level of spill light control, an optional house side shield accessory can be field or factory installed. Electrical LED drivers are mounted to the fixture for optimal heat sinking and ease of maintenance. Thermal management incorporates both conduction and convection to transfer heat rapidly away from the LED source for optimal efficiency and light output. Class 1 electronic drivers have a power factor >90%, THD <20%, and an expected life of 100,000 hours with <1% failure rate. Available in 120-277V 50/60Hz, 347V 60Hz or 480V 60Hz operation. 480V is compatible for use with 480V Wye systems only. 10kV/10 kA surge protection standard. 0-10V dimming driver is standard with leads external to the fixture to accommodate controls capability such as dimming and occupancy. Suitable for ambient temperatures from -40 degree C to 40 degree C. Optional 50 degree C HA (high ambient) available. Standard NEMA 3-PIN twistlock photocontrol receptacle and NEMA 7-PIN twistlock photocontrol receptacles are available as options. Controls The Prevail LED luminaire control options are designed to be simple and cost-effective ASHRAE and California Title 24 compliant solutions. The ANSI C136.41 compliant NEMA 7-PIN receptacle enables wireless dimming when used with compatible photocontrol. An integrated dimming and occupancy sensor is a standalone control option available in on/ off (MSP) and bi-level dimming (MSP/DIM) operation. The optional LumaWatt Pro system is best described as a peer-to-peer wireless network of luminaireintegral sensors that operate in accordance with programmable profiles. Each sensor is capable of motion and photo sensing, metering power consumption and wireless communication. Mounting Standard pole mount arm is bolted directly to the pole and the fixture slides onto the arm and locks in place with a bolt facilitating quick and easy installation.

"Lumark PRVS-A60-UNV-T4 163W Discreet LED Area Lighting, 2 LEDs, 18900 Lumens, 120-277V, Type IV Distribution",LUMARK-PRVS-11,$707.85,"Technical Spec  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION The Prevail LED area, site luminaire combines optical performance, energy efficiency and long term reliability in an advanced, patent pending modern design. Utilizing the latest LED technology, the Prevail luminaire delivers unparalleled uniformity resulting in greater pole spacing. A versatile mount standard arm facilitates ease of installation for both retrofit and new installations. With energy savings greater than 62%, the Prevail fixture replaces 150-450W metal halide fixtures in general area lighting applications such as parking lots, walkways, roadways and building areas. PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS Construction Construction is comprised of a heavy-duty, single-piece die-cast aluminum housing. The LED drivers are mounted in direct contact with the casting to promote low operating temperature and long life. The die-cast aluminum door is tethered to provide easy access to the driver if replacement is required. A one-piece silicone gasket seals the door to the fixture housing. The optics is mounted on a versatile, aluminum plate that dissipates heat from the LEDs resulting in longer life of the fixture. The fixture is IP66 and 3G vibration rated (ANSI C136.31) to insure strength of construction and longevity in the selected application. Optics Precision molded, high efficiency optics are precisely designed to shape the distribution, maximizing efficiency and application spacing. Available in Type II, III, IV and V distributions with lumen packages ranging from 6,100 to 18,900 nominal lumens. Light engine configurations consist of 1 or 2 high-efficacy LEDs mounted to metal-core circuit boards to maximize heat dissipation and promote long life (up to L92/60,000 hours at 25 degree C) per IESNA TM-21. For the ultimate level of spill light control, an optional house side shield accessory can be field or factory installed. Electrical LED drivers are mounted to the fixture for optimal heat sinking and ease of maintenance. Thermal management incorporates both conduction and convection to transfer heat rapidly away from the LED source for optimal efficiency and light output. Class 1 electronic drivers have a power factor >90%, THD <20%, and an expected life of 100,000 hours with <1% failure rate. Available in 120-277V 50/60Hz, 347V 60Hz or 480V 60Hz operation. 480V is compatible for use with 480V Wye systems only. 10kV/10 kA surge protection standard. 0-10V dimming driver is standard with leads external to the fixture to accommodate controls capability such as dimming and occupancy. Suitable for ambient temperatures from -40 degree C to 40 degree C. Optional 50 degree C HA (high ambient) available. Standard NEMA 3-PIN twistlock photocontrol receptacle and NEMA 7-PIN twistlock photocontrol receptacles are available as options. Controls The Prevail LED luminaire control options are designed to be simple and cost-effective ASHRAE and California Title 24 compliant solutions. The ANSI C136.41 compliant NEMA 7-PIN receptacle enables wireless dimming when used with compatible photocontrol. An integrated dimming and occupancy sensor is a standalone control option available in on/ off (MSP) and bi-level dimming (MSP/DIM) operation. The optional LumaWatt Pro system is best described as a peer-to-peer wireless network of luminaireintegral sensors that operate in accordance with programmable profiles. Each sensor is capable of motion and photo sensing, metering power consumption and wireless communication. Mounting Standard pole mount arm is bolted directly to the pole and the fixture slides onto the arm and locks in place with a bolt facilitating quick and easy installation.
